# conductivity_inverse1d

A computational math project, one-dimentional medium restoration with eds signal inversion. It is a console app for Windows 10 made in Visual Studio 2022, but it does not contain platform-specific issues and can be built from source by other cpp compilers.
Description of the direct problem (in Russian) is provided in the pdf.

The project contains a part of my bachelor diploma, it does not provide any convenient user interface or even incorrect input protection. Some parts of it are written in a bad codestyle, for example, inverse problem module (inverse_task.cpp). I am not eager to fix them, but I would not mind doing it in an interview though.
